This is a linguistic resource on iconicity in sign languages. It contains annotated data and visualisation tools on iconicity patterns in non-abstract nouns from 7 semantic fields in 19 languages. The video recordings of signs used here are from the [Spreadthesign project](www.spreadthesign.com).

This resource contains different types of data:

* A database containing 1542 signs annotated according to several iconicity features
* A map-based visualisation tool of iconicity features by concept
* A map-based visualisation tool of iconicity features by semantic field
* A tool to generate graphs showing distribution of iconicity features by semantic fields

You can read more about the methodology of our research on the About tab.
